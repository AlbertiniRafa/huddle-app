# Mobile App Development Guide

## Option 1: React Native Mobile App (Recommended)

### What you need:
- React Native CLI or Expo CLI
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year for iOS)
- Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time for Android)

### Steps to create mobile app:

1. **Convert existing code to React Native**
```bash
npx create-expo-app FamilySportsApp
# Copy components and adapt for mobile
```

2. **Key changes needed:**
- Replace Next.js routing with React Navigation
- Adapt UI components for mobile screens
- Add native features (camera, GPS, push notifications)
- Implement app store authentication

3. **Build and deploy:**
```bash
# For iOS
expo build:ios
# Submit to App Store Connect

# For Android  
expo build:android
# Upload to Google Play Console
```

## Option 2: Progressive Web App (PWA) - Faster Launch

### Convert current website to installable app:

1. **Add PWA manifest**
```json
{
  "name": "FamilySports",
  "short_name": "FamilySports",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Add service worker for offline functionality**
3. **Users can "Add to Home Screen" from browser**
4. **Works like native app but through web browser**

## Option 3: Hybrid App with Capacitor

### Wrap your web app as native app:
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init FamilySports com.familysports.app
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npx cap run ios
npx cap run android
```

## Recommended Approach:

**Phase 1**: Deploy PWA (1-2 weeks)
- Quick to market
- Users can install from website
- Test user adoption

**Phase 2**: Native React Native app (4-6 weeks)
- Full native features
- App store presence
- Better performance

## App Store Requirements:

### iOS App Store:
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- App review process (1-7 days)
- Privacy policy required
- Age rating for family apps

### Google Play Store:
- Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time)
- App review process (1-3 days)
- Privacy policy required
- Target API level requirements

## Cost Breakdown:
- **PWA**: $0 (just hosting costs)
- **React Native Development**: $5,000-15,000 (if outsourced)
- **App Store Fees**: $124/year total
- **Maintenance**: $1,000-3,000/month

Would you like me to start with any of these approaches?
